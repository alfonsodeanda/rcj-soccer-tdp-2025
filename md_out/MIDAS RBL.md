We use 2 ultrasonic sensors, one on the side and one at the back, and they have the function that when they do not see the ball, they return to the point marked by the ultrasonic sensors.

## Mechanical Design

*How did you design the mechanical parts of your robots?*

our designer uses fusion360 to create the mechanical parts that are adapted to the pcb and the space left after placing all the components and the wires he previously made, I consider the arrangement of the drivers to be different since they are positioned optimally to save space

## Build Method

*How did you build your design?*

for the pcb "JLCPCB" , For 3D printing, we use a 3D printer "PrusaSlicer MK3".

## Electronics Block Diagram

*Provide us with a block diagram of your robot's electronics*

![](images/1HdUoKAxjaxQd3u_NImBhgZAM4k20FgSX.jpg)

## Power Circuit

*How does your power circuits work?*

For the 5V motors and regulators, we power them with 7V; for the Teensy and the Pixy, we power them with the voltage output from the 5V regulator. The ultrasonic sensors, LED indicator, driver, and compass are powered with 3.3V coming from a 3.3V regulator, and those come from the 5V regulator.

## Motor Drive Circuit

*How do you drive your motors? Explain the circuits you use for that*

We activate the motors through a programming that uses two digital pins and a PWM per driver; with the digital pins we control the direction in which the motor rotates and with the PWM the speed at which it moves. The driver is connected to the 3 pins that go to the Teensy 4.1, the VIN 7V, GND, and 3V.

## Microcontroller & Reason

*What kind of micro controller or board do you use for your robot? Why did you decide to use this part for your robot? If you have more than 1 processor, explain each one separately.*

The Teensy 4.1 has better processing and helps us save space on the PCB, has a large number of pins, a large amount of memory, just like the Teensy 4.0 it also saves space, features a fast processor, and efficient power consumption.

## Ball Detection

*How does your ball detection sensors and/or camera[s] work?*

the pixy has a function to detect colors called color connected components.

## Line Detection

*How does your line detection circuits work?*

We have 32 photoresistors and 32 LEDs that form a circle on the lower plate, we have 2 multiplexers and each one drives 16 signals from the photoresistors to the Teensy 4.0, we calibrate each photoresistor so that it marks 1 if it is white and 0 if it is not.

## Navigation/Position Sensors

*What sensors do you use for navigation and how are these sensors connected to your processor? What sensors do you use to find your position in the field? What about the direction your robot faces?*

To detect the ball we use Pixys 2.0 and 2.1, for positioning on the field we use ultrasonic URM09, for line detection we use photoresistors, for orientation we use a CMPS14 compass, to connect the cameras we use SPI SS and analog connections, for the ultrasonic sensors we use analog connections, for the multiplexer we use analog and digital pins, for the compass we use I2C connection. In robot 2, it is oriented forward using the compass, while robot 1 has the difference that when the ball is in front, it positions itself with a camera that sees the goal, and when the ball is not in front, it positions itself using the compass.

## Motor Control

*How do you use your processor to move your motors?*

A code that works with zeros and ones is downloaded to the processor to direct which way to move. It also has a PWM so that all the motors have a similar speed.

## Ball Detection Method

*How do you find where the ball is? How do you read the data from the ball detection sensors or camera?*

The Pixy is connected to a servo motor with a fixed angle of 90 degrees. We made 5 sections with the 180 degrees of the servo motor. In addition, there is a formula to detect if it is far or near. This helps the camera's precision to be more efficient.

## Ball Catch Algorithm

*How does your algorithm work to catch the ball? Is there a difference between your robots in how they move towards the ball? Explain the differences.*

N/A

## Line Algorithm

*How does your robot find the lines to stay inside the field? What algorithms do you use to avoid going out of bounds?*

By calibrating each photoresistor, we mark one if it is white and 0 if it is not white, then we divide the circle formed by the photoresistors and we make combinations of lines to have sections and know which side to go to, we pass that data to the main processor in which some lines are combined and the actions for detection are carried out in each of them.

## Goal Algorithm

*What algorithms do you use to score goals? How do you use your kicker and dribbler to handle the ball?*

N/A

## Defense Algorithm

*What algorithms do you use to avoid the opponent team scoring? How do your robots defend your own goal?*

When one robot has the ball, the other robot must be defending in a neutral position. When the robot that had the ball no longer sees it, the other must see it and change.A code that works with zeros and ones is downloaded to the processor to direct which way to move. It also has a PWM so that all the motors have a similar speed.

## Robot Communication

*Do your robots communicate with each other? How do you use this communication to your advantage?*

N/A

## Innovation2

*Innovations*

Servo camera is the function in which we follow the ball in a way with 5 sections of the servo motor since there is a division of 180 degrees also add a function to know if the ball is far or near, this helps us so that the robot makes more optimal decisions for the positioning of the ball, this data is sent to the main processor and the main processor gives the order of the movements of the motors so that the robot moves making the movements when following the ball efficient, these movements have a section of subroutines in which it is facilitated so that the code is shorter, faster and easier
