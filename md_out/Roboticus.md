## Cost

*How much did it cost you to build your robots?*

Robots with sponsoring: 1481.47 USD (1267.25 Euro) each
Robots without sponsoring: 2864.09 USD (2449.94 Euro) each
Experimenting and testing (estimation): 583,93 USD (500 Euro) in total
Environment: Unknown, but the new robotics lab must have cost our school a fortune.

## Funding

*How did you gathered the funds to build the robots?*

To build a competitive robot, having access to high-quality components is essential, but these parts can be expensive. That’s why this team has been investing a lot of time and effort in creating a strong sponsorship plan. By presenting our project professionally and showing our goals, progress, and potential, we were able to gain support from sponsors. This process took many years, as it can be hard to be taken seriously as a junior student team. But with the right amount of effort and proof of the team’s potential, we were able to strike deals with big companies related to robotics or a similar field. Which led us to be able to cut the total costs of our robots by almost 50%. This allowed us to afford more advanced and durable components, such as carbon fiber sheets, OpenMV cameras, Maxon Motors and many more discounted products. Thanks to this support, our robot is more reliable, efficient, and ready to perform at the highest level during the world championship. Besides the robots, the only reason why we are able to make it to Brazil and participate is thanks to our main sponsor Robeco, in return we will help them to reach their social goal to create equal opportunities for kids. We will be hosting free robotics workshops for kids with parents that are financially limited. With this we and Robeco hope to inspire the engineers of the future.
