## Mechanical Design

*How did you design the mechanical parts of your robots?*

We used SolidWorks to design our robot and got ideas by researching other RoboCup teams' designs. We considered size limits, weight, and sensor placement. After testing, we improved the kicker position and front shape for better performance.

## Build Method

*How did you build your design?*

We built our robot using 2D-cut acrylic parts, which we designed in SolidWorks and cut using a laser cutter. We used basic tools like a drill, saw, screwdriver, and glue gun to assemble the parts.
We didn’t make custom PCBs—instead, we used off-the-shelf electronic modules like motor drivers, controllers, and sensors. For parts like wheels and brackets, we used ready-made components and adapted them to fit our design.
During testing, we made some changes such as re-shaping the chassis for better ball control and adjusting the kicker position to improve its power and accuracy.

## Motors & Reason

*How many motors have you used and why?*

We used 4 DC motors with omni-wheels for better stability and precise control. This setup is more effective than 3 motors. The omni-wheels were purchased, not custom-made.

## Kicker Design

*If your robot has a kicker, explain how you designed and built the mechanics of the kicker*

We used a JF-0530B solenoid (12V) boosted to 36V using an XL6009 converter and a 4700µF capacitor. It’s controlled by MOSFETs connected to the JoinMax X4. The solenoid is placed in the dribbler zone at an ideal distance for kicking.

## Dribbler Design

*If your robot has a dribbler, explain how you designed and built the mechanics of the dribbler.*

We used a 2200KV brushless motor with a tire mounted directly for friction. It’s controlled by an ESC connected to the JoinMax X4. The motor is fixed using a 90 degree mount for proper ball contact.

## Mechanical Innovation

*Mechanical Innovation*

One of the parts we are most proud of is the overall distribution of components inside our robot. We carefully arranged the motors, kicker, dribbler, battery, and sensors in a way that keeps the robot well-balanced, compact, and within RoboCup size and weight limits.
This layout was not random—it was designed to maximize space efficiency while making sure all components are easily accessible for repairs or adjustments. For example, we placed the kicker at the ideal distance in the ball capturing zone and mounted the dribbler without blocking the field of view of the sensors.
Even though our robot doesn't use advanced mechanical systems like custom 3D parts, we believe that our simple, smart, and rule-compliant design is an innovation in itself, making the robot stable, effective, and competition-ready.

## Electronics Block Diagram

*Provide us with a block diagram of your robot's electronics*

![](images/1T4mCHuLyoanL3vhktThF8l5GiJAobtU4.png)

## Power Circuit

*How does your power circuits work?*

We use an 11.1V battery. An LM2596 step-down provides 5V to the JoinMax X4 and OpenMV camera. The 11.1V powers the motors and ESC, while an XL6009 boost raises voltage to 36V for the kicker.

## Motor Drive Circuit

*How do you drive your motors? Explain the circuits you use for that*

We use a 5-channel motor driver connected to the JoinMax X4 for the 4 movement motors. The dribbler is controlled by an ESC connected directly to the JoinMax controller.

## Microcontroller & Reason

*What kind of micro controller or board do you use for your robot? Why did you decide to use this part for your robot? If you have more than 1 processor, explain each one separately.*

We use the JoinMax X4 for motor and sensor control. It has a touchscreen GUI for easy debugging. We also use an OpenMV camera, which tracks the goal and sends signals to the JoinMax.

## Ball Detection

*How does your ball detection sensors and/or camera[s] work?*

We use a compound IR seeker with 7 channels:

West, 2. NW, 3. Upper NW, 4. Front, 5. Upper Front-East, 6. NE, 7. East.
The channel with the strongest signal indicates the ball’s direction, which is sent to the JoinMax X4.

## Line Detection

*How does your line detection circuits work?*

We use light sensors around the robot: 3 front, 3 left, 3 right, and 2 back. They’re connected to the JoinMax X4, and when a white line is detected, the robot moves in the opposite direction to stay inside the field.

## Navigation/Position Sensors

*What sensors do you use for navigation and how are these sensors connected to your processor? What sensors do you use to find your position in the field? What about the direction your robot faces?*

We use the OpenMV camera to find the goal when the ball is captured. We use 4 ultrasonic sensors (one on each side) to find our position on the field, and a compass to know the direction the robot is facing. All sensors are connected to the JoinMax X4.

## Kicker Circuit

*How do you drive your kicker system? How does the circuit make the kicker work?*

Our kicker system uses a JF-0530B 12V solenoid, which is driven by a custom-built high-voltage circuit. The circuit works as follows:
We use a boost converter (XL6009) to step up the voltage from 11.1V to 36V.
A 4700 µF, 50V capacitor stores the boosted energy and releases it quickly when needed to activate the solenoid.
The solenoid is controlled by MOSFETs, which act as electronic switches.
The JoinMax X4 controller sends a signal to the MOSFETs to close the circuit and fire the solenoid at the right moment.

## Dribbler Circuit

*How does your dribbler system work? What components and circuits did you use to drive it?*

Our dribbler system uses a 2200KV brushless DC motor to spin a rubber tire mounted directly on the motor shaft. The tire increases friction with the ball, helping to keep it in front of the robot while moving.
To drive the brushless motor, we use an ESC (Electronic Speed Controller), which is connected directly to the JoinMax X4 controller. The controller sends PWM signals to the ESC to control the motor’s speed.
The motor is mounted securely on the robot using a 90-degree motor bracket, placing it at the right height and angle for effective ball contact.
This setup provides consistent rotation and strong ball control, especially during fast movement and turns.

## Innovation

*Innovations*

We are most proud of our kicker circuit because it was the most challenging electronic part to design and get working correctly. At first, the kicker wasn’t strong enough and the circuit was unstable, but after testing and improvements, we developed a custom high-voltage kicker system that works reliably.
The circuit uses a boost converter (XL6009) to raise the voltage from 11.1V to 36V, and a 4700µF, 50V capacitor to store and release energy quickly to the JF-0530B solenoid. The solenoid is triggered through MOSFETs, which are controlled by the JoinMax X4 controller.
We had to carefully manage charging time, trigger timing, and component ratings to prevent overheating or failure. After testing different configurations, we achieved a powerful, fast, and safe kicker system, and we’re proud of the innovation and effort that went into making it work properly.

## Motor Control

*How do you use your processor to move your motors?*

The JoinMax X4 sends PWM signals to the motor driver for movement motors, and to the ESC for the dribbler. It calculates speed and direction based on sensor inputs like ball and line detection.

## Ball Detection Method

*How do you find where the ball is? How do you read the data from the ball detection sensors or camera?*

We use two IR seekers (front and back) for 360° ball tracking. Each has 7 channels. The strongest signal shows the ball direction, and the JoinMax X4 uses that info to move toward the ball.

## Ball Catch Algorithm

*How does your algorithm work to catch the ball? Is there a difference between your robots in how they move towards the ball? Explain the differences.*

The robot uses both seekers to find the ball and curves around it to align with the dribbler. If using two robots, one attacks while the other defends or supports based on position.

## Line Algorithm

*How does your robot find the lines to stay inside the field? What algorithms do you use to avoid going out of bounds?*

Our robot uses an array of light sensors placed around the base (front, back, left, and right) to detect the white boundary lines on the field. These sensors are connected to the JoinMax X4 controller, which continuously checks their readings.
When any sensor detects a white line, the robot immediately moves in the opposite direction to avoid crossing the boundary. The algorithm is simple but effective—it doesn’t rely on complex calculations; it just reacts quickly to line detection to keep the robot inside the field.
This direct response helps the robot stay in play without getting stuck or going out of bounds.

## Goal Algorithm

*What algorithms do you use to score goals? How do you use your kicker and dribbler to handle the ball?*

When the robot is facing the goal and close enough, we programmed it to stop the dribbler to reduce ball spin and allow better control. Then, the kicker is activated to shoot the ball toward the goal.

In some situations, we keep the dribbler running during the kick to add more power or spin to the shot, especially when the robot needs to shoot quickly while moving.

The combination of goal detection (via camera) and distance control allows the robot to decide the right moment to stop or continue the dribbler and activate the kicker for an accurate and effective shot.

## Defense Algorithm

*What algorithms do you use to avoid the opponent team scoring? How do your robots defend your own goal?*

We use a simple but effective algorithm for defense. Our goalkeeper robot constantly checks for the ball using the IR seeker. When the ball comes into its field of view, the robot starts tracking it.

If the ball enters the goalkeeper’s ball capturing zone, the robot moves forward to block or capture it, preventing the opponent from scoring. If the ball moves away, the keeper returns to its default defensive position in front of the goal.

This reactive behavior allows the goalkeeper to quickly respond to threats and cover the goal efficiently.

## Robot Communication

*Do your robots communicate with each other? How do you use this communication to your advantage?*

N/A

## Innovation2

*Innovations*

We are most proud of the obstacle avoidance algorithm we developed for situations where the ball gets stuck between our robot and an opponent in the ball capturing zone.

In this situation, instead of pushing against the other robot and wasting time, our algorithm makes the robot quickly back off and curve around to try a new angle of attack. The robot detects that it's not gaining control of the ball or not moving forward as expected, and then triggers the avoidance behavior.

We came up with this idea after noticing that in many matches, robots get stuck in front of each other fighting over the ball. By backing off and repositioning, our robot can break the deadlock, regain control, and continue playing effectively.

This algorithm has helped us win more games by keeping our robot active, avoiding unnecessary stalls, and giving it a better chance to score or pass.
