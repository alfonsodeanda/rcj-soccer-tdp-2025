## Mechanical Design

*How did you design the mechanical parts of your robots?*

We used previous designs as reference and Cadsoft EAGLE to design everything.

## Build Method

*How did you build your design?*

Everything was handmade, self manufactured. The circuits, using thermal transfer and FeCl3 for corrosion. The rest of the structure using resin and grinding tools.

## Motors & Reason

*How many motors have you used and why?*

4 motors for movement, 1 motor for dribbler. 
Using 4 motors for directions, we have more strength and speed on every vector.

## Kicker Design

*If your robot has a kicker, explain how you designed and built the mechanics of the kicker*

N/A

## Dribbler Design

*If your robot has a dribbler, explain how you designed and built the mechanics of the dribbler.*

We added the dribller without planning to have one, so we used a free space, a small dc motor controlled by a TIP122 transistor and connected to a printer bearing.

## Mechanical Innovation

*Mechanical Innovation*

The whole PCB is what we are most proud of. Every aspect of it, desingning, manufacturing and soldering the components, troubleshooting and adapting things, it was quite a challenge.

## Mechanical Photos

*Photos of your mechanical designs highlights*

## Electronics Block Diagram

*Provide us with a block diagram of your robot's electronics*

## Power Circuit

*How does your power circuits work?*

We use a LiPo Battery of 7.4V to supply everything, regulated to 5V / 3V3 in order to power the sensors.

## Motor Drive Circuit

*How do you drive your motors? Explain the circuits you use for that*

We use a VNH5019 for every motor.

## Microcontroller & Reason

*What kind of micro controller or board do you use for your robot? Why did you decide to use this part for your robot? If you have more than 1 processor, explain each one separately.*

We use Arduino DUE for controlling everything in the robot, becuase of the PWM outputs and many GPIO Pins for upgrades.

## Ball Detection

*How does your ball detection sensors and/or camera[s] work?*

We use a HiTechnich IRSeeker To detect the position of the ball.

## Line Detection

*How does your line detection circuits work?*

We use a green led and a LDR sensor to detect light reflection. There are 4 sensors, each one detecting a direction.

## Navigation/Position Sensors

*What sensors do you use for navigation and how are these sensors connected to your processor? What sensors do you use to find your position in the field? What about the direction your robot faces?*

We use a GY-26 Compass to control the robots position. By comparing the actual state of the compass with a previous saved value, we make the robot always front-forward.

## Kicker Circuit

*How do you drive your kicker system? How does the circuit make the kicker work?*

N/A

## Dribbler Circuit

*How does your dribbler system work? What components and circuits did you use to drive it?*

Everytime the ball is detected in front of the robot, the Dribbler starts running and stops when the ball changes position or a white line is detected.

## Motor Control

*How do you use your processor to move your motors?*

We check the position returned by the IRSeeker and move the robot to the direction behind that position, in order to face the ball. We made a function to control the 4 motor controllers at once.

## Ball Detection Method

*How do you find where the ball is? How do you read the data from the ball detection sensors or camera?*

We read the position returned by the IRSeeker.

## Ball Catch Algorithm

*How does your algorithm work to catch the ball? Is there a difference between your robots in how they move towards the ball? Explain the differences.*

The robots work with the same algorithm.

## Line Algorithm

*How does your robot find the lines to stay inside the field? What algorithms do you use to avoid going out of bounds?*

Everytime a LDR value changes greatly, means a line was found. The robot stops and moves in the opposite direction to return to field.

## Goal Algorithm

*What algorithms do you use to score goals? How do you use your kicker and dribbler to handle the ball?*

Go forward and release the ball stopping the dribbler when the line is detected.

## Defense Algorithm

*What algorithms do you use to avoid the opponent team scoring? How do your robots defend your own goal?*
